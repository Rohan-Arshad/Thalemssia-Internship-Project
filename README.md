This project aimed to develop a machine learning system for thalassemia detection using haemoglobin electrophoresis data, with a primary focus on minimizing false positive diagnoses while maintaining clinically acceptable sensitivity. The model was designed not only to classify patients but also to stratify them into three urgency tiers (low, medium, and high risk) to guide clinical decision-making.
